# gemlib
A compilation of FRC robot programming tools.

Something something standing on the shoulders of giants. This is a few months of work and may still be largely discarded in favor of WPILIB 2020. Includes code examples of our 2018 functionality on the state machine model. 

Many thanks for inspiration, code and wisdom:
